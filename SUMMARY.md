**LaRS: A Diverse Panoptic Maritime Obstacle Detection Dataset and Benchmark** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 53301 images with 41852 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *water*, *obstacle*, *static obstacle*, and other: *sky*, *boat/ship*, *buoy*, *row boats*, *other*, *swimmer*, *paddle board*, *animal*, and *float*.

Images in the LaRS dataset have . There are 50498 (95% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (32375 images), *test* (17966 images), and *val* (2960 images). Additionally, the images have ***seq name*** and ***seq id*** tags, that help associate every image with a parent sequence. Each of 8 dynamic obstacle labels has ***supercategory*** tag. The dataset was released in 2023 by the University of Ljubljana.
